      <h3 class="center">some info on the my 'career'</h3>
      <p>My first interaction with computers started with a spiderman video game I picked up my first year of kindergarden. It fulfilled me and entertained me so much that the whole time I was at school I just anticipated going home and playing it. My mother however limited me to one hour of video games for a few years until she loosened her grip and I could moderate myself around the fifth grade. My academic success has never existed. Throughout elementry school it was because I for some reason cant stay focused very well. When the middle school era came around the teaching was done in a way that kind of suited me, but my grades were still dead because they had serious homework assignments, and their was no way in hell I was going home and doing work rather than play Xbox.</p>

      <p>Throughout middle school I had no choice but to play Xbox because I did not have the funds to build a PC, but I always envied them PC aryans because they got all of the cool Minecraft updates years before us console peasants did. I was lucky enough to meet <span style="color: red;">Jay Ashworth</span> who somehow had his leg up on computer gaming. He took me under his wing and showed me the way of the PC master race. For years I trained. Adventuring to the lengths and depths of Midgard, fasting 40 days multiple times until I had enough shekels to forge my Computer.</p>

      <p>The summer break between eight and ninth grade I finally did it, but I didnt know how to put an OS on it. Once again I needed Jays mind to teach me. He told me how to put Windows 7 on it and from there I tought myself how to do basic things like that. A year later I was making my own Call of Duty: World at War zombies map. Then in the tenth grade I started making bare bones html websites, and a year later Ms. Sinclair started teaching me how to make websites with purpose. THem at the end of the school year she assigned me a project in which I have to talk about myself. Yeah!</p>
